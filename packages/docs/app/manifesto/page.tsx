              Modern software engineering is splintered. APIs live in one framework, background jobs in another, queues

              all of these concerns viz. <span className={gradientText}>API endpoints, scheduled tasks, background

              We are standing at the edge of a new chapter in software engineering driven by AI and large language
              models. These technologies are automating workflows previously handled by humans and shifting the
              bulk of work to backend automation systems. This shift is introducing a <span className={gradientText}>massive
              influx of complexity</span> into existing architectures, similar to the transition from PHP spaghetti code era
              to structured MVC frameworks and the later rise of React for UI complexity.

              History shows that <span className={gradientText}>complexity is always followed by abstraction</span>. The

              Just as past complexity demanded new frameworks, this backend fragmentation requires a unified solution. 
              Consider what it takes to build a typical backend today, teams are juggling Express.js/Flask for APIs, BullMQ for queues, 
              traditional cron jobs for scheduling, Next.js API routes for endpoints, and separate workflow engines for orchestration, each requiring different setup, monitoring, and deployment strategies:

              <p>
                Drawing inspiration from the power of simple, elegant primitives like React's 'component', Motia
                introduces the <span className="font-medium text-white">"step"</span>. This core concept distills
                complexity into four fundamental, easy-to-understand elements:
              </p>

              <ul className="list-inside list-disc space-y-[30px]">
                <li>
                  <span className="font-medium text-white">Trigger:</span> How a step is initiated (via API, event
                  bus, or scheduled task).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <span className="font-medium text-white">Receive:</span> How it accepts input data.

                <li>
                  <span className="font-medium text-white">Activate:</span> How it performs logic or an action.

                <li>
                  <span className="font-medium text-white">Emit:</span> How it optionally outputs data or triggers other steps.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p className="mb-[10px]">
                With just these four concepts, software engineers can build anything they need in Motia, particularly <span className={gradientTextBlue}>with Steps being language and runtime agnostic.</span>

              <p className="mb-[18px]">
                But the power of Motia isn't just in its simplicity; it's in what it abstracts away, mirroring React's
